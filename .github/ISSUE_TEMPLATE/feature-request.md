<!-- BEFORE YOU SUBMIT...

* read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/citycide/trilogy/blob/master/contributing.md)
* make sure the issue isn't already [being tracked](https://github.com/citycide/trilogy/issues)
* should be reproducible with the latest version of trilogy

You should always include as much information as possible about the problem -
help maintainers and contributors help you back:

* relevant error messages ( including stack traces )
* any uncommon or "abnormal" environment configurations
* link to a [minimal reproducible](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) case, ie. a GitHub repo
  ( this is the fastest way to a solution! )

If a section below isn't relevant feel free to get rid of it, but be
prepared to provide more information if necessary.
