***trilogy*** is a simple Promise-based wrapper for SQLite databases.
It supports both the native C++ [`sqlite3`][sqlite3] driver and the pure
JavaScript [`sql.js`][sqljs] backend &mdash; compile natively for speed
when you need it, or use `sql.js` headache-free in cross-platform environments
and [Electron][electron] apps.

It's not an ORM and isn't intended to be one &mdash; it doesn't have any
relationship features. Instead it focuses on providing a simple, clear API
that's influenced more by [Mongoose][mongoose] than by SQL.

## features

* :link: **automatically casts data between JavaScript & SQLite types**

  Define schemas with types like `String`, `Date`, or `'increments'` &mdash;
  trilogy will handle all the type-casting involved to map accurately
  between JavaScript and the underlying SQLite database.

* :battery: **powered by the [knex][knex] query builder**

  trilogy uses knex internally to build its queries, but it's also exposed so
  you can use it to build your own. No need to mess with ridiculous multi-line
  strings.

* :nut_and_bolt: **supports multiple swappable backends ( _plus in-memory storage_ )**

  Both the native [`sqlite3`][sqlite3] module _and_ [`sql.js`][sqljs] (pure
  JavaScript!) are supported. There is also memory-only storage for fast,
  unpersisted data handling, which is great for tests and performance critical
  situations.

  You can even swap the backend after you've started, with no changes to the
  rest of your code!

* :cop: **written in [TypeScript][typescript]**

  trilogy is written in and provides a first-class experience for TypeScript.

* :electric_plug: **lifecycle hooks**

  Any number of hooks (aka subscribers or listeners) can be attached at several
  points in the lifecycle &mdash; for example `onQuery`, `beforeCreate`, `afterUpdate`.
  These are useful for debugging and extensibility.

* :revolving_hearts: **perfect for [Electron][electron] & [NW.js][nwjs]**

  Compiling the `sqlite3` module for all the platforms you target with Electron
  or NW.js can be difficult. That's why trilogy also supports the `sql.js` backend,
  which doesn't need to be compiled at all!

## installation

1. Install trilogy

   ```console
   # using yarn
   yarn add trilogy

   # using npm
   npm i trilogy
   ```

2. Install a backend

   ```console
   # using yarn
   yarn add sqlite3

   # using npm
   npm i sqlite3
   ```

   _or_

   ```console
   # using yarn
   yarn add sql.js

   # using npm
   npm i sql.js
   ```

## usage

Full documentation is [available here][docs] and includes guides, an API
reference, and more.

Here's a quick overview. It uses `async` & `await` but is easily usable with
vanilla Promises.

```js
import { connect } from 'trilogy'

// defaults to using the `sqlite3` backend
const db = connect('./file.db')

// choose `sql.js` to avoid native compilation :)
const db = connect('./file.db', {
  client: 'sql.js'
})

// set the filename to ':memory:' for fast, in-memory storage
const db = connect(':memory:', {
  // it works for both clients above!
  client: 'sql.js'
})

;(async function () {
  const games = await db.model('games', {
    name: { type: String },
    genre: String,            // type shorthand
    released: Date,
    awards: Array,
    id: 'increments'          // special type, primary key
  })

  await games.create({
    name: 'Overwatch',
    genre: 'FPS',
    released: new Date('May 23, 2016'),
    awards: [
      'Game of the Year',
      'Best Multiplayer Game',
      'Best ESports Game'
    ]
  })

  const overwatch = await games.findOne({ name: 'Overwatch' })

  console.log(overwatch.awards[1])
  // -> 'Best Multiplayer Game'
})()
```
